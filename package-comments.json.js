     CHANGE PROPOSAL: WEBPACK 5 (Eject create-react-app:)
        - use federated modules:
          > create app container as master
          > create routes as master
          > create tasks list as remote
          > create form as remote
          > create any components library as remote
          > allow for agnostic language building - create views in vue or angular for example
      CHANGE PROPOSAL: ESLINT (Eject create-react-app:)
        - enhanced linting to ensure airbox specific code requirments can be kept:
          > copywrite headers top of file
          > code conventions outside air bnb spec's or react eslint spec
